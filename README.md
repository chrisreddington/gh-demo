# GitHub Demo CLI Extension

A GitHub CLI extension for automating repository hydration tasks, such as creating issues, discussions, pull requests, and labels. Built with Go using the `go-gh` library for GitHub API interactions.

## Installation

```bash
gh extension install chrisreddington/gh-demo
```

## Usage

### Basic Hydration

```bash
# Hydrate a repository with demo content (uses default .github/demos directory)
gh demo hydrate --owner myuser --repo myrepo

# Hydrate with custom configuration directory
gh demo hydrate --owner myuser --repo myrepo --config-path custom/config/path

# Hydrate only specific content types (flags default to true)
gh demo hydrate --owner myuser --repo myrepo --discussions=false --prs=false

# Enable debug mode for detailed logging
gh demo hydrate --owner myuser --repo myrepo --debug

# Preview what would be created without actually doing it
gh demo hydrate --owner myuser --repo myrepo --dry-run
```

### Cleanup Operations

```bash
# Clean all existing content before hydrating
gh demo hydrate --owner myuser --repo myrepo --clean

# Clean specific content types
gh demo hydrate --owner myuser --repo myrepo --clean-issues --clean-labels

# Clean with preservation rules
gh demo hydrate --owner myuser --repo myrepo --clean --preserve-config .github/demos/preserve.json

# Preview cleanup operations
gh demo hydrate --owner myuser --repo myrepo --clean --dry-run
```

### Help

```bash
# Get help
gh demo hydrate --help
```

## File Structure

The hydration tool expects JSON files in the configuration directory. By default, this is the `.github/demos/` directory, but it can be customized using the `--config-path` flag:

- `<config-path>/issues.json`: Array of issue objects
- `<config-path>/discussions.json`: Array of discussion objects
- `<config-path>/prs.json`: Array of pull request objects
- `<config-path>/labels.json`: Array of label objects (optional - labels referenced in other files will be auto-created with defaults)
- `<config-path>/preserve.json`: Configuration for objects to preserve during cleanup operations (optional)

### Default Configuration Directory

```bash
gh demo hydrate --owner myorg --repo myrepo
# Uses .github/demos/ directory by default
```

### Custom Configuration Directory

```bash
gh demo hydrate --owner myorg --repo myrepo --config-path custom/config/path
# Uses custom/config/path/ directory relative to project root
```

### Example Files

Example configuration files are included in the `.github/demos/` directory:

- [`issues.json`](.github/demos/issues.json) - Sample issue definitions
- [`discussions.json`](.github/demos/discussions.json) - Sample discussion definitions  
- [`prs.json`](.github/demos/prs.json) - Sample pull request definitions
- [`labels.json`](.github/demos/labels.json) - Sample label definitions with colors
- [`preserve.json`](.github/demos/preserve.json) - Preservation rules for cleanup operations

### Design Principles

- **Dependency Injection**: All external dependencies (GitHub API, file system) are injected via interfaces
- **Context Propagation**: All operations accept `context.Context` for timeout and cancellation handling
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Typed errors with operation context for better debugging
- **Configuration Over Convention**: Flexible configuration with sensible defaults
- **Test-Driven Development**: High test coverage with mocked dependencies

## Testing

This project follows a test-driven development approach with comprehensive test coverage.

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Use mocked dependencies for fast, isolated testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Test real GitHub API interactions (skipped in CI without auth)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests in short mode (skips integration tests)
go test -short ./...

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/githubapi/...
```

### Testing Strategy

- **Table-Driven Tests**: Comprehensive test cases with individual test functions, aiming for ‚â§30 lines of setup
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage with focus on error paths and edge cases
- **GitHub API Client**: Uses dependency injection with `NewGHClientWithClients()` for unit tests and `NewGHClient()` for integration tests
- **Authentication**: Unit tests use mocks and don't require GitHub credentials
- **CI/CD**: Runs tests in short mode to skip integration tests that require authentication
- **Mocking**: ALL external dependencies (GitHub API, file system) are mocked for unit tests

### Test Environment

Tests run against mock implementations by default. Integration tests that require GitHub authentication will:
- Skip automatically if no credentials are available
- Run in short mode during CI/CD to avoid authentication issues
- Can be enabled locally when GitHub CLI authentication is configured

## Development

### Code Quality Standards

This project follows strict code quality standards:

- **Maximum function size**: 80 lines including comments and blank lines
- **Complex functions (>50 lines)** must be broken down into smaller, focused helper functions
- **Descriptive naming**: Use full names (`pullRequest` not `pr`, `repository` not `repo`)
- **Context handling**: ALL I/O functions MUST accept `context.Context` as first parameter
- **Error wrapping**: Wrap ALL errors with meaningful context using typed errors

### Pre-Commit Requirements

Before committing, ensure:

```bash
# Code builds without errors
go build .

# All tests pass
go test ./...

# Code is properly formatted
go fmt ./...

# Linting passes (if golangci-lint is available)
golangci-lint run
```

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build the extension
go build -o gh-demo .

# Install locally for testing (from the project root)
